/**
 * Accepts incoming control connections.
 *
 * When connection is accepted on a predefined port, this class configures it,
 * writes a welcome/reject message into it and adds it to a connection pool which will
 * serve it till the connection dies.
 *
 * Server should not just drop a connection leaving user with no response message. If a
 * connection must be dropped, it should be poisoned instead, this way the connection
 * writes out the message to its user and then dies.
 *
 * This class must be aware of core's POISONED status. When core is poisoned it is the
 * responsibility of a connector to not to allow any more incoming connections, so server
 * can shut down normally.
