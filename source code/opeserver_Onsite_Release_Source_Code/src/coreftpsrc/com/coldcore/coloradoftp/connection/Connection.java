/**
 * Data or control connection.
 * Connections read and write data from and to users.
 *
 * Life cycle of a connection is very simple. When it is accepted and configured it is then
 * added to a connection pool which calls on it service method. When connection dies, the
 * connection pool removes it from its internal list and the connection will be garbage
 * collected.
 *
 * When poisoned, connection must die as soon as it has nothing to read/write to/from user.
 * This is mainly for control connections as data connections do not use it. But since
 * connection pool's specification requires it to poison all connections as soon as server's
 * core becomes poisoned (before shutdown to let everyone finish and leave), the methods are
 * located in this class.
