/**
 * The core itself.

 * Core is responsible for starting/stopping FTP server and all its parts.
 * There is nothing else the core can do because starting from version 1.2
 * all components run in separate threads and therefore execute on their own.
 *
 * Core has a special status names POISONED. This status means that the server is going to shut
 * down and is waiting for all control and data connections to finish and disconnect. All connection
 * pools and control connection acceptors must take core status into consideration.
 *
 * When poisoned and there are no connections left to serve, the server will not neccessarily stop.
 * This is up to the implementation of the core.
